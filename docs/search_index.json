The unit and functional tests will be developed during the initial development stage when writing individual functions or modules. After completing development of multiple modules, integration testing will be developed to verify that different modules work well together. Checks will be added in the software to catch user input errors when conducting run-time testing. Regression testing and platform compatibility testing will be executed before pre-releasing FIMS. Beta-testing will be used to gather feedback from users (i.e. Members of FIMS implementation team and other users) during the pre-releasing stage. After releasing the first version of FIMS, the team will go back to the beginning of the testing cycle and write unit tests when a new feature needs to be implemented. One-off testing will be used for fixing user-reported bugs when maintaining FIMS. More details of each type of test can be found in the Glossary section. FIMS will use GoogleTest to build a C++ unit testing framework and R testthat to build an R testing framework. FIMS will use Google Benchmark to measure the real time and CPU time used for running the produced binaries. 6.2 C++ unit testing and benchmarking 6.2.1 Requirements To use GoogleTest, you will need: A compatible operating system (e.g. Windows, masOS, or Linux). A C++ compiler that supports at least C++ 11 standard or newer (e.g. gcc 5.0+, clang 5.0+, or MSVC 2015+). For macOS users, Xcode 9.3+ provides clang 5.0. A build system for building the testing project. CMake and a compatible build tool such as Ninja are approved softwares by NMFS HQ. 6.2.2 Quickstart for Windows user Download CMake 3.22.1 (cmake-3.22.1-windows-x86_64.zip) and put the file folder to Documents\\Apps or other preferred folder. Download ninja v1.10.2 (ninja-win.zip) and put the application to Documents\\Apps or other preferred folder. Search Edit environment variables for your account and open the Environment Variables window. Click Edit... under the User variables for firstname.lastname section. Click New, add path to cmake-3.21.4-windows-x86_64\\bin, add click OK. Click New, add path to Documents\\Apps, add click OK. Open your Command Prompt and type cmake. If you see details of usage, you install the build system successfully. See CMake installation instructions for installing CMake on other platforms. 6.2.3 Set up FIMS testing project Go to the FIMS C++ tests folder and create a CMakeLists.txt file. Declare a dependency on GoogleTest with following contents: cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14) project(FIMS_project) # GoogleTest requires at least C++11 set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11) include(FetchContent) FetchContent_Declare( googletest URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/refs/tags/release-1.11.0.zip ) # For Windows: Prevent overriding the parent project&#39;s compiler/linker settings set(gtest_force_shared_crt ON CACHE BOOL &quot;&quot; FORCE) FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest) If a CMakeLists.txt file already exists in the tests folder, you can start creating a unit test and add it to the CMakeLists.txt. 6.2.4 Unit test template #include &quot;gtest/gtest.h&quot; #include &quot;../src/code.hpp&quot; // # R code that generates true values for the test namespace { // Description of Test 1 TEST(TestSuiteName, Test1Name) { ... test body ... } // Description of Test 2 TEST(TestSuiteName, Test2Name) { ... test body ... } } 6.2.5 Unit test example Let’s create dlognorm.hpp that has a simple function: #include &lt;cmath&gt; template&lt;class Type&gt; Type dlognorm(Type x, Type meanlog, Type sdlog){ Type resid = (log(x)-meanlog)/sdlog; Type logres = -log(sqrt(2*M_PI)) - log(sdlog) - Type(0.5)*resid*resid - log(x); return logres; } We can create a test file dlognorm-unit.cpp that has a test suite for this function: #include &quot;gtest/gtest.h&quot; #include &quot;../src/dlognorm.hpp&quot; // # R code that generates true values for the test // dlnorm(1.0, 0.0, 1.0) = -0.9189385 // dlnorm(5.0, 10.0, 2.5) = -9.07679 namespace { // TestSuiteName: dlognormTest; TestName: DoubleInput and IntInput // Test dlognorm with double input values TEST(dlognormTest, DoubleInput) { EXPECT_NEAR( dlognorm(1.0, 0.0, 1.0) , -0.9189385 , 0.0001 ); EXPECT_NEAR( dlognorm(5.0, 10.0, 2.5) , -9.07679 , 0.0001 ); } // Test dlognorm with integer input values TEST(dlognormTest, IntInput) { EXPECT_NE( dlognorm(1, 0, 1) , -0.9189385 ); } } EXPECT_NEAR(val1, val2, absolute_error) verifies that the difference between val1 and val2 does not exceed the absolute error bound absolute_error. EXPECT_NE(val1, val2) verifies that val1 is not equal to val2. Please see GoogleTest assertions reference for more EXPECT_ macros. 6.2.6 Add tests to CMakeLists.txt and run a binary To build the code, add the following contents to the end of your CMakeLists.txt file: enable_testing() add_executable( dlognorm_test dlognorm-unit.cpp ) target_include_directories( dlognorm_test PUBLIC ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../ ) target_link_libraries( dlognorm_test gtest_main ) include(GoogleTest) gtest_discover_tests(dlognorm_test) The above configuration enables testing in CMake, declares the C++ test binary you want to build (dlognorm_test), and links it to GoogleTest (gtest_main). Now you can build and run your test: cd tests cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja cd build cmake --build . ctest The output might look like this: Start 1: dlognormTest.DoubleInput 1/2 Test #1: dlognormTest.DoubleInput ......... Passed 0.36 sec Start 2: dlognormTest.IntInput 2/2 Test #2: dlognormTest.IntInput ............ Passed 0.01 sec 100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 2 Total Test time (real) = 0.37 sec Congratulations! You’ve successfully set up a test project and run a test binary using GoogleTest. Let’s use Google Benchmark to measure the real time and CPU time used for running the produced binary. 6.2.7 Benchmark template #include &quot;benchmark/benchmark.h&quot; #include &quot;../src/code.hpp&quot; void BM_FunctionName(benchmark::State&amp; state) { for (auto _ : state) // This code gets timed Function() } // Register the function as a benchmark BENCHMARK(BM_FunctionName); 6.2.8 Benchmark example We will continue using the dlognorm.hpp example. We can create a benchmark file dlognorm_benchmark.cpp and put it in the tests folder: #include &quot;benchmark/benchmark.h&quot; #include &quot;../src/dlognorm.hpp&quot; void BM_dlgnorm(benchmark::State&amp; state) { for (auto _ : state) dlognorm(5.0, 10.0, 2.5); } BENCHMARK(BM_dlgnorm); Please see more examples on Google Benchmark GitHub repository for a more comprehensive feature overview. 6.2.9 Add benchmarks to CMakeLists.txt and run the benchmark To build the code, add the following contents to the end of your CMakeLists.txt file: FetchContent_Declare( googlebenchmark URL https://github.com/google/benchmark/archive/refs/tags/v1.6.0.zip ) FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googlebenchmark) add_executable( dlognorm_benchmark dlognorm_benchmark.cpp ) target_include_directories( dlognorm_benchmark PUBLIC ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../ ) target_link_libraries( dlognorm_benchmark benchmark_main ) To run the benchmark, cd build ./dlognorm_benchmark.exe The output might look like this: ***WARNING*** Library was built as DEBUG. Timings may be affected. ---------------------------------------------------------------- Benchmark Time CPU Iterations ---------------------------------------------------------------- BM_dlgnorm 128 ns 126 ns 5600000 6.3 R testing FIMS uses R testthat package for writing R tests. You can install the packages following the instructions on testthat website. If you are not familiar with testthat, the testing chapter in R packages gives a good overview of testing workflow, along with structure explanation and concrete examples. 6.3.1 R testthat template test_that(&quot;TestName&quot;, { ...test body... }) 6.4 Test case template and examples 6.4.1 Test case template Individual functional or integration test cases will be designed following the template below. Test ID. Create a meaningful name for the test case. Features to be tested. Provide a brief statement of test objectives and description of the features to be tested. (Identify the test items following the FIMS software design specification document and identify all features that will not be tested and the rationale for exclusion) Approach. Specify the approach that will ensure that the features are adequately tested and specify which type of test is used in this case. Evaluation criteria. Provide a list of expected results and acceptance criteria. Pass/fail criteria. Specify the criteria used to determine whether each feature has passed or failed testing. In addition to setting pass/fail criteria with specific tolerance values, a documentation that just views the outputs of some tests may be useful if the tests require additional computations, simulations, and comparisons Test deliverables. Identify all information that is to be delivered by the test activity. Test logs and automated status reports 6.4.2 Test case examples 6.4.2.1 General test case The test case below is a general case and it can be applied to many functions/modules. For individual functions/modules, please make detailed test cases for specific options to avoid duplication as much as possible. Test ID General test case Features to be tested The function/module returns correct output values given different input values The function/module returns error messages when users give wrong types of inputs The function/module notifies an error if the input value is outside the bound of the input parameter Approach Prepare expected true values using R Run tests in R using testthat and compare output values with expected values Push tests to the working repository and run tests using GitHub Actions Run tests in different OS environments (windows latest, macOS latest, and ubuntu latest) using GitHub Actions Submit pull request for code review Evaluation Criteria The tests pass if the output values equal to the expected true values The tests pass if the function/module returns error messages when users give wrong types of inputs The tests pass if the function/module returns error messages when user provides an input value that is outside the bound of the input parameter Test deliverables Test logs on GitHub Actions 6.4.2.2 Functional test example: TMB probability mass function of the multinomial distribution Test ID Probability mass function of the multinomial distribution Features to be tested Same as the general test case Approach Functional test Prepare expected true values using R function dmultinom from package ‘stats’ Evaluation Criteria Same as the general test case Test deliverables Same as the general test case 6.4.2.3 Integration test example: Li et al. 2021 age-structured stock assessment model comparison Test ID Age-structured stock assessment comparison (Li et al. 2021) Features to be tested Null case (update standard deviation of the log of recruitment from 0.2 to 0.5 based on Siegfried et al. 2016 snapper-grouper complex) Recruitment variability Stochastic Fishing mortality (F) F patterns (e.g., roller coaster: up then down and down then up; constant Flow, FMSY, and Fhigh) Selectivity patterns Recruitment bias adjustment Initial condition (unit of catch: number or weight) Model misspecification (e.g., growth, natural mortality, and steepness, catchability etc) Approach Integration test Prepare expected true values from an operating model using R functions from Age_Structured_Stock_Assessment_Model_Comparison GitHub repository Evaluation Criteria Summarize median absolute relative error (MARE) between true values from the operating model and the FIMS estimation model If all MAREs from the null case are less than 10% and all MARES are less than 15%, the tests pass. If the MAREs are greater than 15%, a closer examination is needed. Test deliverables In addition to the test logs on GitHub Actions, a document that includes comparison figures from various cases (e.g., Fig 5 and 6 from Li et al. 2021) will be automatically generated A table that shows median absolute relative errors in unfished recruitment, catchability, spawning stock biomass, recruitment, fishing mortality, and reference points (e.g., Table 6 from Li et al. 2021) will be automatically generated 6.5 Glossary 6.5.1 Unit testing Description: It tests individual methods and functions of the classes, components or modules used by the software independently. It executes only small portions of the test cases during the development process. Writer: Developer Advantages: It finds problems early and helps trace the bugs in the development cycle; cheap to automate when a method has clear input parameters and output; can be run quickly. Limitations: Tedious to create; it won’t catch integration errors if a method or a function has interactions with something external to the software. Examples: A recruitment module may consist of a few stock-recruit functions. We could use a set of unit test cases that ensure each stock-recruit function is correct and meets its design as intended while developing the function. Reference: Wikipedia description 6.5.2 Functional testing Description: It checks software’s performance with respect to its specified requirements. Testers do not need to examine the internal structure of the piece of software tested but just test a slice of functionality of the whole system after it has been developed. Writer: Tester Advantages: It verifies that the functionalities of the software are working as defined; lead to reduced developer bias since the tester has not been involved in the software’s development. Limitations: Need to create input data and determine output based on each function’s specifications; need to know how to compare actual and expected outputs and how to check whether the software works as the requirements specified. Examples: The software requires development of catch-based projection. We could use a set of functional test cases that help verify if the model produces correct output given specified catch input after catch-based projection has been implemented in the system. Reference: Wikipedia description; WHAM testthat examples 6.5.3 Integration testing Description: A group of software modules are coupled together and tested. Integrate software modules all together and verify the interfaces between modules against the software design. It is tested until the software works as a system. Writer: Tester Advantages: It builds a working version of the system by putting the modules together. It assembles a software system and helps detect errors associated with interfacing. Limitations: The tests only can be executed after all the modules are developed. It may be difficult to locate errors because all components are integrated together. Examples: After developing all the modules, we could set up a few stock assessment test models and check if the software can read the input file, run the stock assessment models, and provide desired output. Reference: Wikipedia description 6.5.4 Run-time testing Description: Checks added in the software that catch user input errors. The developer will add in checks to the software; the user will trigger these checks if there are input errors Writer: developer Advantages: Provides guidance to the user while using the software Limitations: Adding many checks can cause the software to run more slowly, the messages need to be helpful so the user can fix the input error. Examples: A user inputs a vector of values when they only need to input a single integer value. When running the software, they get an error message telling them that they should use a single integer value instead. Reference: Testing R code book 6.5.5 Regression testing Description: Re-running tests to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change. Testers can execute regression testing after adding a new feature to the software or whenever a previously discovered issue has been fixed. Testers can run all tests or a part of the test suite to check the correctness or quality of the software. Writer: Tester Advantages: It ensures that the changes made to the software have not affected the existing functionalities or correctness of the software. Limitations: If the team makes changes to the software often, it may be difficult to run all tests from the test suite frequently. In that case, it’s a good idea to have a regression testing schedule. For example, run a part of the test suite that is higher in priority after every change and run the full test suite weekly or monthly, etc. Examples: Set up a test suit like the ss-test-models repository. The test cases can be based on real stock assessment models, but may not be the final model version or may have been altered for testing purposes. Test the final software by running this set of models and seeing if the same results for key model quantities remain the same relative to a “reference run” (e.g., the last release of the software). Reference: Wikipedia description 6.5.6 Platform compatibility testing Description: It checks whether the software is capable of running on different operating systems and versions of other softwares. Testers need to define a set of environments or platforms the application is expected to work on. Testers can test the software on different operating systems or platforms and report the bugs. Writer: Tester Advantages: It ensures that the developed software works under different configurations and is compatible with the client’s environment. Limitations: Testers need to have knowledge of the testing environment and platforms to understand the expected software behavior under different configurations. It may be difficult to figure out why the software produces different results when using different operating systems. Examples: Set up an automated workflow and see if the software can be compatible with different operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. Also, testers can check if the software is compatible with different versions of R (e.g., release version and version 3.6, etc). Reference: International Software Testing Qualification Board 6.5.7 Beta testing Description: It is a form of external user acceptance testing and the feedback from users can ensure the software has fewer bugs. The software is released to a limited end-users outside of the implementation team and the end-users (beta testers) can report issues of beta software to the implementation team after further testing. Writer: Members of implementation team and other users Advantages: It helps in uncovering unexpected errors that happen in the client’s environment. The implementation team can receive direct feedback from users before shipping the software to users. Limitations: The testing environment is not under the control of the implementation team and it may be hard to reproduce the bugs. Examples: Prepare a document that describes the new features of the software and share it with selected end-users. Send a pre-release of the software to selected users for further testing and gather feedback from users. Reference: Wikipedia description; SS prerelease example 6.5.8 One-off testing Description: It is for replicating and fixing user-reported bugs. It is a special testing that needs to be completed outside of the ordinary routine. Testers write a test that replicates the bug and run the test to check if the test is failing as expected. After fixing the bug, the testers can run the test again and check if the test is passing. Writer: Developer and tester Advantages: The test is simple, fast, and efficient for fixing bugs. Limitations: The tests are specific to bugs and may require manual testing. Examples: A bug is found in the code and the software does not work properly. Tester can create a test to replicate the bug and the test would fail as expected. After the developer fixes the bug, the tester can run the test and see if the issue is resolved.
