# .hpp template for C++ modules

In this section we will describe how to structure a new .hpp file in FIMS.
```c
//  tmplate.hpp
//  Fisheries Integrated Modeling System (FIMS)

//define the header gaurd
#ifndef template_hpp 
#define template_hpp

//inherit from model_base
#include "../common.hpp" 
#include <iostream>

/**
 * In this example, we utilize the concept of inheritence and 
 * polymorphism (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/polymorphism-in-c/). All
 * classes inherit from model_base. Name1 and Name2 inherit from NameBase.
 * Classes Name1 and Name2 must implement they're own version of 
 * "virtual T evaluate(const T& t)", which will have unique logic. 
 */
