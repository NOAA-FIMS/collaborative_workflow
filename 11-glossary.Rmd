## C++ Glossary

Some C++ vocabulary that is used within FIMS that will be helpful for novice C++ programmers
to understand.

### singleton

Defines a class that is only used to create an object one time. This is a design pattern.

See more [information](https://www.positioniseverything.net/cpp-singleton)

### class

Provides the "recipe" for the structure of an object, including the data members and functions. 
Like data structures (structs), but also includes functions.

See more [information](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes/).

### functor

A functor is a class that acts like a function.

See more [details about functors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/function-objects-in-the-stl?view=msvc-170). 
### constructor

A special method that is called when a new object is created and 
usually initializes data members of the object.

See the [definition of constructor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/constructors-c/).

### destructor

The last method of an object called automatically before an object is destroyed.

See the [definition of destructor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/destructors-c/).

### header guards

Makes sure that there are not multiple copies of a header in a file.

Details are [available](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/header-guards/).

### preprocessing macro/derectives

Begin with a `#` in the code, these tell the preproccessor (not the compiler) what to do.
These directives are complete before compiling.

See more info on [preprocessing](https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/preprocessor/)

### struct

Similar to a class, but only contains data members and not functions. All members are public. Comes from C.

See [details on struct](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_structs.asp.)
