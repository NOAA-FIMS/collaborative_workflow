# Welcome

Welcome to the Fisheries Integrated Modeling System (FIMS) developer handbook. This is a book written in **markdown** describing the workflow for FIMS developers and contributors. It is intended to be a living document and will change over time as FIMS matures.

Suggestions or contributions to the handbook may be made via the FIMS collaborative workflow GitHub site <https://github.com/NOAA-FIMS/collaborative_workflow>. Please follow the steps below if you wish to make a change to this book,

1. Create a new feature branch off of main (dev for FIMS and case-studies) and edit the files in the branch.
1. When you are done editing, push your changes to the remote feature branch.
1. Pushing to the remote feature branch initiates a GitHub action that creates a .zip file that you can download and unzip. Open the file index.html in a browser to preview the rendered .html content. If the action fails, this means the bookdown could not be rendered. Use log from the GitHub to determine the problem with the files.
1. When the book can be rendered and you are satisfied with the changes, submit a pull request to merge the feature branch into `main`.
