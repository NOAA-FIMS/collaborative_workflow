# Code of Conduct

## FIMS Contributor Conduct

All contributors participating and contributing to the FIMS project are
expected to adhere to the [Contributor
Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).
Briefly, these standards are adopted to ensure a positive and
harassment-free enviroment for all participants. Examples of behavior
that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our
mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
overall community

## Supporting Good Conduct

FIMS Community leaders will create default community health files (e.g.
CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT) to be used in all repositories owned by
FIMS.

### Reporting Unacceptable Behavior

Questions about the FIMS Code of Conduct or reports of unacceptable
behavior should be sent to fims.conduct@noaa.gov. Reports will be
reviewed by a member of the NOAA Fisheries Office of Science and
Technology who is not participating in the FIMS Project [Jim Berkson],
but has the full support of FIMS Community Leaders. All reports will be
reviewed promptly and fairly.

### Consequences of Violating Conduct

People who violate the FIMS Contribute Conduct will face meaningful
consequences, up to and including explusion from the FIMS Community. The
Code of Conduct, as well as consequences for violations, apply equally
to all participants.
